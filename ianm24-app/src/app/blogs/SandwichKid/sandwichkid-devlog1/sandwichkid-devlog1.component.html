    <h1>Getting Set Up: Sandwich Kid Devlog 1</h1>
    <h4>Posted 12 June 2020 6:40PM EST</h4>

    <p>So the first meeting on May 30th was used to establish what each person would be doing, the name of the development group, and the style of the game we are making. The division of work is shown in the project intro. After debating between the two top names, Heckböi Crüe, and Goon Games, we decided on the latter since some people have an unfavorable connotation for heck but goon is relatively harmless. As far as the art style went, we decided on one similar to the bright and whimsical colors of Earthbound, but not limiting ourselves to 16-bit assets. The weekly tasks were relatively simple. Kai would do more work on the design documents, the artists and musicians would get familiar with the style we were going for and Julian and I worked on setting up a GMS2 project in a github repo with a simple 2D walking simulator. We also set up a Google Drive folder for asset requests, feedback, design documents, and as a place for the artists and musicians to put their finished work so they don't have to learn the git workflow.</p>

    <p>Then Julian and I got to work on the walking sim. Most of the work we did was getting familiar with the Game Maker Language and the new version of the engine with most issues being GUI related and fixed easily once we found the "Draw GUI" event. We made a player, walls with collision, and sandwich items to pick up. Sandwiches must start with a type of bread so that we dont have sandwiches with tomatoes as bread. We started off with an object-oriented approach to sandwich objects so that it is simple to make new items. When a player does pick up an item, it is displayed on the tab menu.</p>

    <p>We also set up a versioning system. Game Maker uses a 4 number versioning system so we went with the following:</p>

    <p>The following is our final walking sim with temporary assets, Version 0.1.1.0:</p>

    <p>Alongside this, Megan worked on some sandwich concept art for the toppings and actual sandwich of the BLT.</p>

    <p>After this little bit of progress, we waited for a more descriptive design document to continue. The next meeting was June 7th due to schedule conflicts on Saturday the 6th. This was the first week of development. It felt very good to finally get a start on this project and I hope you continue to follow these devlogs.</p>
